# What is this project?
Well, it was spring break, and I wanted to whip up a small project that mimicked [The Chia Network](https://www.chia.net/about/). This cryptocurrencies whole stick is to
make the work required to get paid so difficult that it makes more sense to precalculate some answers and simply search your storage drive for answers instead of attempting
to solve with the CPU in real time. In no way is this project on the scale of Chia, and in no way is the code professional, but it was a proof of concept, which I think is 
pretty cool.
