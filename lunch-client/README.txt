Python Interpreter I used and you should too:
https://www.anaconda.com/
(Has Windows and Linux Versions)

Library's you need to run the .py files:
Windows Commands:

pip install requests
pip install rsa

Linux Commands:

pip3 install requests
pip3 install rsa
(Because it has to specify python 3 for some Linux Versions who have python 2 and 3)
